+ Project Requirements
    - Recurse through each pixel up to 7 times to find all reflection
    - End recurse at level seven, or if reflection total drops to 0%, or if no object found
    - Multiply color added at each level by (current overall reflection)-(object reflection) for each level
    - Calulate refraction for each level
