# CS430Project1

Both included images are the same, except one is encoded in P3, and the other is P6.

C File Name = "main.c"
argv[1] = input file name
argv[2] = output file name
argv[3] = output format, so only input 3 or 6

So, if I wanted to convert a P3 ppm to a P6 ppm I would run "Main.c" with input file "faceP3.ppm" and output to "faceP6.ppm" and do this with the following command in terminal:

./main faceP3.ppm faceP6.ppm 6
